Based at the University of Arizona College of Pharmacy, the center serves the entire state of Arizona with the exception of Maricopa County, providing free and confidential poison and medication information to callers around the clock</p></li>
            <li><p>Specialists answering the phones at the center regularly receive calls from center urges anyone who feels a mysterious sting, pinch or bite while outdoors to immediately calls center at 800-222-1222</p></li>

                    <p>The center advises anyone who might come cross paths with rattlesnakes to aware of these five Things</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><p>Baby rattlesnakes range in length from 6 to 12 inches and are easily camouflaged by brush and grass </p></li>
                        <li><p> Baby rattlesnakes are rattleless until they first shed their skins, so there will be no
                            infamous "chica-chica" sound before they strike.</p></li>
                        <li><p>Despite their impish size, baby snakes have enough venom to be very dangerous
                            if they bite a human.</p></li>
                        <li><p>Adult rattlesnakes do not always rattle an audible warning before or while they
                            are biting</p></li>
                        <li><p>It's a good idea to call the poison center if you notice an unidentified small cut or
                            wound, even if you feel no pain. With the lack of telltale rattle warning, people
                            can be bitten without knowing what has happened until they notice their
                            symptoms and attribute them to a snakebite.
