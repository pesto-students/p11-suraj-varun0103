            I'm Nobody! Who are you<br>
            Are you - Nobody - Too? <br>
            Then there's a pair of us!<br>
            Don't Tell! They'd banish us- you know!
            <br>
            <br>
            
                How deary - to be- Somebody!<br>
                How public - like a Frog - <br>
                To Tell one's name - livelong June -<br>
                to an admiring Bog!<br>
